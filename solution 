  #select returns a new object (e.g. array) filled with only those original items where the block you gave it returned true
  
  #Basically the purpose of this is shown in line 10 - 11  is that it will select the array/word and iterate over it by splitting the word and sorting the letters and if the letters are equivalent to the letter in the @name it is true and will match.
